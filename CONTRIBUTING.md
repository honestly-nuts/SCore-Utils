### Code structor:
#### resources/:
  The resources directory is for resources that the repository itself is dependent on. It contains mostly images for the readme.
#### src/:
  The src directory is for the source files of the project. All code goes here (with nuances).
#### tests/:
  The tests directory contains unit tests for all the programs. It also containes source files for the [TPP pre processor](https://github.com/honestly-nuts/TPP)
  but I don't force that anymore because I know it isn't the most convenient way to make a test file and It was a experimental Idea anyway. :)

### Important files:
  1. common.py: the file that contains common functions and classes (eg. write_err, Color)

### branches:
####   1. master: sacred branch that is the most stable
####   2. development (default) : unstable branch with the latest cutting edge technologies
####   3. tmp:
#####     1. colors: everything colors, is a little ahead from development but gets merged with development very quickly 

### If you want to contribute, here are some guidelines:

#### 1. Error handling:
  1. You should check the length of sys.argv for errors at the ``` if __name__ == "__main__": ``` code block.
  2. If you have too few or too many sys.arguments then you should ```sys.stderr.out("Too many/few arguments")```.
  3. You should always ``` sys.stderr.write("Usage: program_name arguments")```(not literally) after an error.
#### 2. Styling
  1. You should use _ inbetween words (eg. grep_file).
  2. You should make comments to explain what a line or block does
  3. You should create non-gibrish variable and function names.

## Did not fit in any sections:
  1. I suggest you to stick to the standard library if you can. But if you can't then you should list how to install the library in the requirments subsection in 
  the [readme](https://github.com/honestly-nuts/Scuffed-Utils/blob/development/README.md) like so:
  
    python
     - Library name: command to install it (eg. pip[3] install library)
    git
    
Feel free to suggest guidelines that you think should be in here but are not because I have a brain that has a size of -1 units;
