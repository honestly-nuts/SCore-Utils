# KINDA ABANDONED BUT KINDA NOT SO YEAH

# Intro
## SCore-Utils ( working name )

<img src=https://github.com/honestly-nuts/Scuffed-Utils/blob/development/resources/scuffed_utils_dark_logo_python_scheme.svg width=300 height=280>

**SCore-Utils** is a remake of the original gnu coreutils in python. The goal of this project is to make a modular utility package that people can use as a library and to make modifying the programs a lot easier.

# Advantages over the original
  1. Is easier to contribute to:

     1. The original core-utils is written in c. And even though I **love** C as a language, I can't really say it is easy to work with. If you don't use an IDE, building
    big projects is a pain in the *cough* *cough* (make I hate you). That's where python comes in handy, Python is an **interpreted language**. While it does impact its speed a little bit,
    comes with its advantages such as: platform independent, doesn't need to compile, etc. So no matter how many imports you have you just `./program` and it just works.
    Another advantage of python is that it's a very readable and semi-easy to learn language. So even if you don't know python but know other languages, you can easily modify the code after learning
    python over a weekend.

     2. contrary to popular belief, This is a small project. So if you notice a bug in a program or want to add your own implementation of a program or want to add a 
    new program, there is a greater chance that your pull request will be accepted here than The original core-utils.

  2. Modular:
     1. All the programs used in this repository are designed to be flexible and fairly self-contained. So if you want to use any of the functions from a program, You can just import the program.

### Why, just Why should you use this.
please ðŸ˜¢

# How to install
#### Pre-requests
```
1.python
2.git
```
#### First clone this repository in your desired place:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/honestly-nuts/SCore-Utils/
```
#### Then, cd to the repository you cloned:
```bash
cd SCore-Utils/
```
#### Then, make sure the install script is executable and run the install script:
note: only run the install script once or it will write a duplicate path in PATH environment variable.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
#### Then either restart your terminal or source your bashrc file with ```source ~/.bashrc```. Then you are good to go.

## But what about windows.

well If you are on windows, I recommend you to use gitbash. I'm not completely sure that the install.sh will work on gitbash, if so then add the path of the  
src folder in the environment path variable. while this works, you have to type "program.py" instead of "program". So I'm looking into making a bat script. 
If anyone is on windows, please help me out.
